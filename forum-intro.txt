Hi,
I've been working with Quaqua (7.3.4) in several Maven projects for some time,
and have started publishing these to the Central Maven Repository. Wanting all
their dependencies published there as well, I have packaged up Quaqua and its
native libraries, and am in the process of publishing these to Central.
(Snapshots are currently in the Sonatype snapshot repository)

The jar and zip-of-native-libraries are published under my own Maven group id,
org.devzendo, not ch.randelshofer, as I can't publish there. Their contents are
taken from the releases from the Quaqua site, and the pom.xml files published
with them cite Werner's copyright, and choice of licenses.

If this is of interest, please see http://devzendo.org/content/mavenised-quaqua
for more details. I hope to publish 7.3.4 as a non-snapshot later this week - if
there are
no objections. Then, upgrade to 8.

Regards,
Matt Gumbley
